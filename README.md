# HRCompanyDB

This is a project born out of a real world necessity of my first client: my own initial employer! An HR Company!
We desperately needed a database solution: a system which would allow employees to:

1) Add candidates
2) Add notes to candidates (current employer, financial expectations, various comments, client for whom they were taken in, dates of contact, GDPR agreement status, history with our company)
3) Keep track of candidates' recruitment progress (we're a recruitment agency so it's a token note for stuff like reporting, operations analysis etc.)
4) Scale with a big number of candidates in time


Current tech stack is:

Backend: Python, Flask (currently not the focus)

Database: MongoDB 

Frontend: HTML, CSS (currently the focus)

Technolgies I would love to use: Angular/React; Tailwind CSS; node.js;
